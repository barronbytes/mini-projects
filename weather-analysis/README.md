# EDA of Brazil Exporter Coffee Output vs Weather Trends [üè°](https://github.com/barronbytes/mini-projects/tree/main)

This mini-project allowed me to use pandas for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with the following scenario:

> You are a data engineer at a Brazil-based weather prediction startup called Curu-Sight. The goal of this startup is to analyze **weather trends** in Brazil and predict the **output** of non-durable consumer goods at harvest time.

> One major threat (barring tariffs) to Brazil's biggest export, coffee, is **leaf rust**. This fungus thrives in humid environments and causes plants to wither. Your company recently won a contract with the local government of Minas Gerais to analyze how humidity (and auxiliary measures) determine the yearly output of coffee.

> You will analyze a dataset that contains averages calculated based on rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind metrics collected during the coffee growing season. You will also analyze a dataset that contains Minas Gerais' crop output. You will then combine these two datasets to explore how the weather influences coffee growth.

## Prerequisites [üîù](#eda-of-brazil-exporter-coffee-output-vs-weather-trends-)

Before running this project locally, ensure you ahve the following installed:

* IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
* Instally Python 3.10+ version > for type hinting compatability
* Install pandas and matplotlib: `pip install pandas matplotlib`

## Lessons Learned [üîù](#eda-of-brazil-exporter-coffee-output-vs-weather-trends-)

I learned to do the following with CSV data:

* Concatenate datasets with identical columns > `explore_weather.ipynb` > create new CSV file > `data/weather/weather_data.csv`
* Merge datasets with different columns > `analysis.ipynb`
* Clean data > remove null value rows
* Filter data > select based upon criteria
* Use pandas for visualiztaions > line plots, histograms
* Calculate and interpret Pearson correlation coefficients

## Jupyter Notebooks [üîù](#eda-of-brazil-exporter-coffee-output-vs-weather-trends-)

There are three Jupyter notebooks with EDA findings:

* notebooks/explore_weather.ipynb
* notebooks/explore_coffee.ipynb
* notebooks/analysis.ipynb

## Datasets [üîù](#eda-of-brazil-exporter-coffee-output-vs-weather-trends-)

There are three CSV files:

* **data/weather/** > `weather_data1.csv`, `weather_data 2.csv`: This datset contains weather data from **January to May**.
* **data/crop/** > `coffee_output.csv`: This dataset contains coffee harvest data from **June to September**.
