# Asteroids [üè°](https://github.com/barronbytes/mini-projects/tree/main)

This project is a retro-style Asteroids game built with Python's Pygame. The end result was converted to a browser-compatible format using Pygbag and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Features [üîù](#asteroids-)

- **Pygame:** Utilized to create 5 classes for game environment.

## Prerequisites [üîù](#asteroids-)

Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 2.6.1 or above)
- Pygame module
- VcXsrv (if running WSL--instructions below)
- Pygbag (will need this to create web-ready version of project)

## Installations [üîù](#asteroids-)

### Pygame Setup [üîù](#asteroids-)

1. Setup virtual environment:
``` bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install Pygame using requirements.txt file:
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Verify Pygame installation:
``` bash
python3 -m pygame
```

### VcXsrv Setup [üîù](#asteroids-)

1. Open the PowerShell (not Linux) terminal and ensure you have WSL2 installed with this command:
``` powershell
wsl --version # This will verify if installed
wsl --install -d Ubuntu # Run this line only if not installed
```
2. Install [VcXsrv](https://vcxsrv.com/) on Windows. [This medium article](https://medium.com/@youngtuo/run-pygame-through-wsl2-in-3-steps-2ee0b776dbaa) provides detailed installation steps.
3. Open the Linux terminal, and save changes to the configuration file.
``` bash
nano ~/.bashrc # Opens config file
export DISPLAY=$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0 # Save to end of file
source ~/.bashrc # Applies changes
```
4. Use the Linux terminal to confirm changes work properly. (A popup window of eyes should open if everything works.)
``` bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install x11-apps # 11 are numbers
xeyes
```
5. This works the first time. On subsequent attempts to run your code, you should **ALWAYS** open a new session of VcXsrv. You do this by launching the **XLaunch** app.

### Pygbag Setup [üîù](#asteroids-)

1. Be inside project folder before using Linux commands
2. Linux (update package manager): sudo apt update
3. Linux (virtual environment): python3 -m venv myenv && source myenv/bin/activate
4. Linux (install pygbag): pip install pygbag
5. Linux (verify install): pygbag --version
6. Edit **main.py** file only as instructed by the [pygbag community](https://pygame-web.github.io/wiki/pygbag/).
7. Linux (convert files): **pygbag .**

## Usage (How To Play!) [üîù](#asteroids-)

Use keyboard strokes to control spaceship:
- Move up: *w* or *up* arrow
- Move down: *s* or *down* arrow
- Move left: *a* or *left* arrow
- Move right: *d* or *right* arrow
- Shot asteroids: *spacebar*

User keyboard or mouse actions to exit game:
- Click upper righthand corner 'X' to close game browser (only works on pygame version)
- Click **Esc** button (works on both pygame and web version)

## Development Roadmap [üîù](#asteroids-)

### Setbacks

This was my first project using both **vector math** and **Pygame**. While I referred to Pygame's documentation throughout the project, [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) provided significant guidance in teaching me how to use the library effectively. This project allowed me to wrestle with game design decisions.

### Successes

I applied object-oriented programming concepts (like abstract classes and inheritance) and functional programming techniques, while also improving the project's documentation. After realizing Pygame cannot run in browsers, I discovered [Pygbag, a tool for converting Python to WebAssembly](https://pygame-web.github.io/wiki/pygbag/), and used the newly converted files [to deploy the game on GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

### Improvements

The project's features and deployment model can be improved. Game logic can be updated to track leaderboard scores, monitor game lives, and support touchscreen input for mobile and tablet users. Additionally, my initial attempt to use a YAML file for continuous deployment failed. [Pygbag provides deployment documentation](https://pygame-web.github.io/wiki/publishing/github.io/) for using YAML files and GitHub Actions for this deployment model.
