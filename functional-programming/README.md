# Functional Programming [üè°](https://github.com/barronbytes/mini-projects/tree/main)

This repo contains small methods created to practice the following concepts:

* __Core concepts:__ immutability, sum types, pure functions, first-class functions, higher-order functions, recursion, function transformations, decorators, currying, closures, memoization
* __Techniques:__ map(), filter(), reduce()

Comments on individuals files:

* __sum_chars_by_doc_word_length.py :__ The program accepts as input a string. The methods map(), filter(), and reduce() are used to process the document. The program returns an integer for a character count that meets a certain criteria.

* __check_nba_season_information.py :__ The program applies the concepts of sum types (enums), function transformations, and closures. If decorators had been used, then lines 94 and 95 would have been unnecessary. The program processes end-of-season NBA standings, providing information about team rankings, home court advantage, and playoff opponents.
